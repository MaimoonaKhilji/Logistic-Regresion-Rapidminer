# Logistic-Regresion-Rapidminer

* 1. Use Logistic Regression and build a model using Sonar Dataset.
* 2. Use single independent variable for prediction and calculate accuracy.
* 3. Use two independent variables for prediction and calculate accuracy score.
* 4. Use all the independent variables for prediction and calculate accuracy score.
* 5. which one performs better?
* 6. Use cross validation for the best performed model.
